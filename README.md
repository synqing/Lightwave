# Project Summary

  ## Please study the source code in detail to understand what it's capable of and how it works
### 1. We are building ontop of an open source music visualisation code 

  - The "Sensory Bridge" (SB), made by LixieLabs is the open sourced project we're using 
  - This SB happens to have the best real time LED music visualisation code we've come across
  - The SB outputs its visualisations to a single LED "channel" of 128 RGBIC LEDs
  - It has features that allow the user to change colours, responsiveness and light show patterns

### 2. The feature that we're trying to develop involves multiplying this LED "channel" by three. 

### 3. We've selected the M5Stack CoreS3 as the development platform 
  - At the moment, the project has already been ported to the M5Stack CoreS3 and added an encoder
